# Weather-App-using-React
This Weather App is a web application built using React that provides real-time weather information for any location. It fetches weather data from a public API and displays details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.

The app features a clean and user-friendly interface where users can search for a city or location to view its current weather. It leverages React hooks for state management and uses Axios or Fetch API to make API requests.

Key features include:

- Search functionality to find weather details for any city.
- Displays temperature, weather icons, and detailed forecasts.
- Responsive design using CSS or Material UI for a seamless experience across devices.
- Error handling for invalid city names or network issues.

This project demonstrates proficiency in React components, API integration, and responsive UI design.
